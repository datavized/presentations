# What is WebXR

- It’s a web page, it’s VR on the web

--
- ...and AR, coming soon
--
...ish?

---

# Why XR on the web?

- Largest platform, everyone has access

--
- Built on the open web, open ecosystem

--
- Accessibility: Easy to share in a URL

--
- No walled garden, anyone can host and publish content

--
- Existing community and web dev knowledge

--
- Failure resistance

???

Open web:
- No reliance on one company
- Support from all major browser vendors (except apple/safari, but cardboard polyfill)
- App stores delete apps for censorship or anti-competitive reasons
- Note that Unity just killed support for Improbable due to license disagreement

Failure resistance:
- support for all major VR headsets (except playstation)
- fallback to screen

# Tech Stack

- Existing web tech: HTML, CSS, JS

--
- WebGL for 3D graphics

--
- Web Audio API

--
- WebVR/WebXR API

--
- Polyfills

--
- JS libraries

???

- basic web tech:
  - basics of delivery
  - experience on-boarding
  - fallback
- WebGL
  - Comparable performance to native mobile VR (Gear VR, Oculus Go, Daydream, etc)
  - Performance scales up with GPU/CPU hardware
- Web Audio API
  - very powerful, basically anything you want to do with audio
  - built-in 3D spatialization
- Polyfill:
  - WebVR/WebXR Polyfill for Cardboard support
  - Marker-based AR, hardware support in progress
